# NeuraEdge NPU Architecture Implementation Status

_Last updated: 2025-08-23 (mesh experiment runner pushed to `feat/mesh-experiments`, optional CI artifacts generated under `build/ci_optional/`; DVFS convergence TB updated to use top-level CSR bus; mem-contention multitile bench build-only PASS)._

_Incremental note (2025-08-22): Added runtime experiment controls and KPI pipeline: introduced runtime plusargs for mesh internal throttling and output pipelining (`+MESH_INT_THROTTLE`, `+MESH_PIPELINED_OUT`), extended the coverage functional TB to emit derived KPIs (`high_depth_utilization_pct`, `per_router_depth_stddev`, `cycles_to_half_depth`, `cycles_to_full_depth`, `fill_slope_half_milli`, `fill_slope_full_milli`), and updated comparison/aggregation tooling and nightly exports to consume these fields. Created a centralized plusarg header `tb/plusargs.svh` and accompanying `tb/README_plusargs.md` and applied the macro to `tb/coverage_functional_tb.v`; per‑testbench consolidation is partial (coverage TB migrated; further benches require per‑bench variable alignment). CI optional harness (`scripts/ci_optional.sh`) was extended with gating env variables for the new KPIs and a timing option for Verilator runs. Paired baseline/experiment runs were executed via the CI harness and JSON diffs show expected occupancy/latency shifts when features are enabled (artifacts under `build/`).
_Experiment summary (2025-08-22): Run a focused three-point experiment matrix (FULL_SIM) to validate runtime pipelining and internal mesh throttling impact on FIFO occupancy and derived KPIs. Artifacts saved in `build/ci_optional/`.

- Baseline (no pipeline, no throttle): `build/ci_optional/coverage_baseline_fullsim.json`
- Pipelined only: `build/ci_optional/coverage_pipelined_fullsim.json` (no meaningful peak-depth change vs baseline in this micro-config)
- Pipelined + internal throttle: `build/ci_optional/coverage_pipe_throttle_fullsim.json` (observed deeper and more uniform occupancy)

Key deltas observed (baseline → pipelined+throttle): max FIFO occupancy 1 → 8, high_depth_utilization_pct 0 → 31, per_router_depth_stddev 0.416 → 3.655, cycles_to_half_depth -1 → 4, cycles_to_full_depth -1 → 38; detailed diffs in `build/ci_optional/compare_baseline_vs_pipe_throttle.txt` and `build/ci_optional/compare_pipelined_vs_pipe_throttle.txt`.

Actionable outcome: enabling both `+MESH_PIPELINED_OUT=1` and `+MESH_INT_THROTTLE=1` produces the intended deeper, more uniform router queue occupancy; we should consider adding this matrix to the nightly regression (opt-in) and expose the JSON artifacts as part of the mesh structural trend dashboard.
_Incremental note (2025-08-22 automation): Added `scripts/run_mesh_experiments.sh`, `scripts/generate_mesh_experiment_summary.py`, and `scripts/plot_mesh_experiment.py` to automate the 3-point experiment matrix, generate diffs, and produce a CSV/plot. Nightly hook added (guarded by `RUN_MESH_EXPERIMENTS=1`) in `scripts/nightly_aggregate.sh`. Local branch `feat/mesh-experiments` contains these changes and generated artifacts under `build/ci_optional/`.
_Incremental note (2025-08-21 earlier multicast uplift): added fanout_ge3 metric + gating `MIN_MCAST_FANOUT3`; formal multicast harness integrated & PASS at depth 16 using abstraction `router_cell_abst` with z3 engine; router_cell output replication logic refactored (eliminated nested per-output always blocks) improving structural clarity; new documentation `MULTICAST_VERIFICATION.md`; optional CI updated with `RUN_FORMAL_MCAST=1` path leveraging abstraction to avoid Yosys parse limitation in full RTL._ 
_Incremental note (2025-08-20 later): Unified router egress handshake counting logic (removed east special-case gating that created phantom pre-stim increment); backpressure TBs (direct + stress + handshake) now validate via external handshake self-count; added `energy_accuracy_tb.v` (linearity of energy accumulation across time windows PASS). Introduced lightweight reference energy accumulator + fast absolute arithmetic test (`energy_accuracy_fast_tb.v`, ~2s). Added optional credit-based flow control to `noc_router_enhanced` (parameters `USE_CREDIT`, `CREDIT_INIT`) with new directed TB `router_credit_flow_tb.v` validating credit exhaustion & stall_bp accumulation. Full-tile absolute energy test (rev2 `tile_energy_absolute_tb.v`) now implemented via direct telemetry reference model (two-phase temp sweep) and will be slated for CI integration after wrapper-based slim harness evaluation._

_Incremental note (2025-08-20 final multicast integration): Implemented mask-based multicast replication (`ENABLE_MCAST`) with atomic release (all targeted outputs must be ready); added directed TBs (`multicast_basic_tb`, `multicast_dual_fanout_tb`, `multicast_backpressure_tb`) plus coverage + histogram TB (`multicast_coverage_tb`). Integrated multicast counters & histogram into `coverage_functional_tb.json`; optional CI gating knobs (`MIN_MCAST_PACKETS`, `MIN_MCAST_FANOUT2`) with defaults (3 / 2) when `RUN_MCAST_TESTS=1`. Nightly aggregation now exports `multicast_summary` (packets, fanout_ge2, histogram, P50/P90). Tightened energy absolute error thresholds (total 0.40%, dyn 0.50%, leak 0.70%). Added formal-style assertion stub `formal/multicast_formal_stub.sv` and in-module simulation assertions to guard replication correctness._

_Incremental note (2025-08-20): Added deterministic `router_pred_cong_tb.v` convergence test (INPUT_BUFFER=0) achieving bit-exact EMA; exposed `predicted_congestion_raw_instant_milli` (debug) aiding analysis of buffer-induced alternating active count; parameterized EMA basis (`PRED_CONG_RAW_MODE`)._
_Incremental note (2025-08-20 mesh multicast smoke): Added preliminary `multicast_mesh_smoke_tb.v` instantiating 2x2 `router_mesh` with multicast forced on all four `router_cell` instances via defparam overrides. Test injects a single flit at (0,0) with E+S mask (first-hop replication) and asserts no unintended local deliveries (mask excludes Local). Current limitation: does not yet observe downstream directional link signals or confirm multi-hop local reception (requires either debug signal exposure in `router_mesh` or enhanced header semantics for multi-dest). Serves as initial mesh-level sanity before adding stronger end-to-end multicast TB and formal mask-popcount invariants._
_Incremental note (2025-08-20 multicast one-hop semantic): Added `MCAST_CLEAR_ON_SEND` (default 1) to `router_cell` so replicated flits have multicast flag cleared post first-hop replication, enforcing current one-hop replication semantic and preventing unintended multi-hop cascading. Future extension may disable clearing to allow staged replication with hop-scoped masks._
_Incremental note (2025-08-20 multicast mesh enhancements): `router_mesh` now has an `ENABLE_MCAST` parameter (eliminating defparam overrides). Added mesh-level TBs: `multicast_mesh_smoke_tb.v` (dual E+S atomic), `multicast_mesh_end_to_end_tb.v` (dual + triple replication atomicity), and `multicast_flag_clear_tb.v` (downstream flag clear). Optional CI (`ci_optional.sh`) updated to include these when `RUN_MCAST_TESTS=1`._
| DVFS / Power Mgmt | ~88% | ~12% | Quadratic leakage path present; cycle-time accurate energy accumulation verified & CI-gated (<1%); multi-temp leakage residual + idle delta characterization done (0.00% max residual, 0.00% idle delta) with CI gating (<2% budget). |
1. Power/Energy follow-up: leakage residual (multi-temp) regression + document error bounds; implement idle leakage scaling factor or explicitly defer.
2. Adaptive sparsity realism: integrate real mask-derived density sampling & weighting; validate transitions with synthetic mask traces.
3. Automation & Reporting: nightly job to regenerate sweeps, run regression + dual frontier, update Markdown/JSON/PNG, auto-commit summary deltas.
4. Verification Expansion: unit tests for analytics scripts; mesh credit propagation TB; coverage model bootstrap; consider promoting absolute energy TB to fast tier after runtime variance study.
5. Documentation: adaptive efficiency scaling diagram; credit flow control description (finalized) & data pipeline flow diagram; energy model section (cycle-time math, CI gating, error budget spec).
6. Threshold Tuning: evaluate tightening delta_power_pct & dyn thresholds post leakage residual stabilization and sustained energy TB stability.
 - Implemented `tile_energy_wrapper.v` + rev2 `tile_energy_absolute_tb.v` (two-phase temperature perturbation) achieving <1% absolute error vs reference; prepared for CI integration.

## 1. High-Level Objective
Deliver a multi-tile neural processing unit targeting high effective TOPS/W via: precision packing, structured sparsity, reuse-aware memory traffic reduction, dynamic power management (DVFS + gating), and rich runtime telemetry to guide adaptive policies.

Target (re-baselined): ~30 effective TOPS/W sustainable (original aspirational 50 TOPS/W) through multiplicative efficiency factors (packing * sparsity * reuse * utilization).

---
## 2. Implemented Components
**Compute & Data Path**
- `neuraedge_tile_50tops`: Integrated PE array (parameterized 32x64) with sparsity engine, power manager, counters, NoC stub.
- `neuraedge_pe_enhanced`: Lane-masked, precision-adaptive PE with power gating hooks.
- Lane activity masking (CSR or external) and precision mode selection.

**Sparsity & Packing**
- Structured sparsity modes (2:4, 1:4, 1:8, adaptive) control path.
- Sparsity engine instantiation with performance gain feedback + active PE count.
- Packing efficiency scaling via milli-factor CSR (`pack_eff_milli`).
- `sparsity_selector` extracted into standalone module (file hygiene; enables reuse & clearer synthesis boundaries).
- `sparsity_adaptive_fsm` integrated: windowed density accumulation + hysteresis + min-hold + manual override + utilization input + efficiency milli output; wired into tile selecting active mode when adaptive enabled; current adaptive mode & efficiency exposed via new CSRs (0x108 / 0x10C). Assertion-based unit TB passing.
 - Adaptive efficiency milli factor now directly scales dynamic power & effective ops (retaining base vs scaled dynamic power signals for audit/regression).

**Power & DVFS**
- `advanced_power_manager`: DVFS FSM with hysteresis, utilization moving average, runtime thresholds (util_high / util_low / perf_hyst_margin / min_settle_cycles) plus frequency/voltage override + telemetry outputs (`current_freq_mhz`, `current_voltage_mv`).
- Characterized P‑state power table (freq, volt, dyn_coeff_mw_per_util, leak_coeff_mw) integrated (configurable via `USE_POWER_TABLE`).
- Calibration harness validates dyn & leak coefficients within ±3% across first 6 P‑states under full utilization.
- Fallback heuristic retained for synthesis experiments (set `USE_POWER_TABLE=0`).
- Per-PE power/clock gating signals plumbed (downstream logic still largely stubbed).

**Telemetry & Instrumentation**
- Counters: physical ops, effective ops, skipped ops, SRAM bytes, DRAM bytes, DMA stall cycles, mask stall cycles.
- Energy: total, dynamic, leakage (pJ accumulation via mW * cycle_time heuristic).
- Utilization: instantaneous + moving average (internal MA exposed).
- Overflow flags (per-counter saturation) with CSR exposure.
- Efficiency grade output from power manager.
- Router telemetry: aggregated flits_in / flits_out (0x0E4/0x0E8) plus Phase 1b banked per-port ingress/egress & stall counters (PORT_SEL 0x0EC, PORT_IN 0x0F0, PORT_OUT 0x0F4, PORT_STALL 0x0F8) and window‑weighted congestion index (0x0FC) implemented. Phase 2 additions now wired: peak inflight milli (0x110), average queue depth milli (0x114), stall arbitration count (0x118), stall buffer-full count (0x11C), backpressure stall count (0x120), predictive congestion EMA (alpha=1/8) (0x124), and banked per-egress remaining credit level (0x128) when credit mode enabled. Congestion index & avg queue depth include held egress flits under credit/backpressure stalls (validated by `router_credit_congestion_tb.v`, preventing dips during credit starvation). Added raw instantaneous active-input milli debug output (`predicted_congestion_raw_instant_milli`) + param `PRED_CONG_RAW_MODE` (buffered vs raw basis). Gated by `ROUTER_TELEM_EN`.

**CSR Infrastructure**
- `simple_csr_block`: Provides control & status registers including:
  - Control: precision, sparsity enable/mode, lane mask, start/stop, reuse factor.
  - Efficiency scaling: `pack_eff_milli`, `sparse_eff_milli`.
  - DVFS thresholds: `util_high_thresh_pct`, `util_low_thresh_pct`, `perf_hyst_margin_milli`, `dvfs_min_settle_cycles`.
  - Telemetry readbacks: all counters, energies, power split, utilization (inst & MA), active PE count, sparsity ratio, efficiency grade, overflow flags, version/feature bitmap, extended router Phase 2 metrics, and leakage quadratic beta coefficient.
- Tile-level CSR override multiplexing (`USE_CSR_CONTROL` capability) for precision/sparsity/lane mask.
- NPU top-level CSR bus (broadcast writes) with tile-select readback (`csr_addr[7:6]`).

**Top-Level Integration**
- `neuraedge_npu_50tops`: Multi-tile (4) assembly with:
  - Power budget distribution & adaptive per-tile power mode adjustment.
  - Aggregation of ops, power, active PEs, efficiency grade, and extended telemetry (energy & bytes).
  - NoC directional wiring placeholders; local output currently stubbed.
- `neuraedge_top.sv`: Prototype single-tile instantiation plus mesh flattened bus loopback for early end-to-end flows (DVFS + memory latency + router). Multi-tile expansion hooks intact.
**NoC / Interconnect**
- `noc_router_enhanced.v`: Minimal dimension-order router (N,E,S,W,L) w/ rotating priority arbitration; Phase 2 telemetry: peak inflight, avg queue depth, stall arbitration vs buffer classification, per-window reset.
- `router_mesh.v`: Functional 2x2 mesh assembly (directional N/E/S/W connectivity, proper ready propagation) hosting a single external port at (0,0); supports multi-hop delivery (validated by flow TB).
**Memory Modeling**
- `memory_latency_injector.v`: Configurable SRAM/DRAM latency + cache-hit probability model with stall / busy cycle telemetry. Now includes: multi-request queue (`QUEUE_DEPTH` param), variable extra latency (0..`EXTRA_LATENCY_MAX`) with distribution modes, widened 16-bit LFSR for variability quality, explicit width casts (no trunc warnings). Integrated via CSRs 0x0BC–0x0C8. Validated: unit, tile-level, and variability histogram (effective wait = base_latency + 1). Fast minimal TB used in CI.
- `memory_latency_injector_contention.v`: Token-bucket DRAM contention wrapper integrated in tile memory path (CSR-controlled). Control/telemetry CSRs: 0x0D4 (enable / tokens_per_cycle / capacity), 0x0D8 (current tokens level), 0x0DC (token stall cycles), 0x0E0 (contention events). Deterministic + stress TBs passing.

**Code Hygiene & Structural**
- Duplicate module suppression using include guards (`noc_router`, `advanced_power_manager` variants, `router_mesh`).
- Added `timescale 1ns/1ps` to major top-level and tile modules.
- Arithmetic widening + narrowed assignments to mitigate overflow & width warnings in counters.
- Extracted inline `noc_router_enhanced` from tile into standalone file; removed duplicate definition.
- Reworked division intermediates & narrowed adds to eliminate WIDTHEXPAND/WIDTHTRUNC issues.
- Added pragma-based suppression for large zero-bus replication (after generate-loop attempt exceeded unroll limits).
- Lint phase 1 complete: removed PINCONNECTEMPTY, GENUNNAMED, malformed DECLFILENAME usage; unified reset style; remaining UNUSED/UNDRIVEN warnings intentionally deferred to final pass.

- Comprehensive instrumentation counters + overflow signaling.
- Runtime-configurable DVFS thresholds and efficiency scaling CSRs.
- Multi-tile NPU assembly with telemetry aggregation.
- CSR bus with tile-select readback convention.
- Basic NoC wiring placeholders + router mesh (guarded) and inline `noc_router_enhanced` stub.
- Duplicate module guard strategy to stabilize lint.
- Initial documentation of overflow bits & version bitmap.

---
## 8. Outstanding Work / Gaps (Updated)
### Functional
- Enhance NoC router: multicast replication, error / drop counters. Credit-based optional flow control (`USE_CREDIT`, `CREDIT_INIT`) implemented + unit TB PASS; remaining: mesh-wide propagation & CSR surfacing of backpressure metrics.
- Memory subsystem: (a) Extend variability distribution modes (triangular / skewed), (b) Add optional bandwidth contention (shared DRAM token bucket), (c) Calibrate DRAM hit probability model.
- Sparsity engine: real mask generation (beyond current counters), refine adaptive density sampling weighting & integrate efficiency feedback into power model.
- Integrate gating signals into real clock/power gating enables (simulation-friendly clock gate wrappers).
- Dynamic lane_active_mask control loop (adaptive disable of underutilized lanes).

### Verification
- Directed CSR + DVFS transition TB (synthetic utilization ramp / oscillation to validate hysteresis & settle time).
- Power table consistency TB (sweep P-states vs coefficients) + fallback heuristic cross-check.
- Memory contention TB (multi-source queued requests, DRAM hit/miss variability coverage, histogram coverage metrics).
- Router mesh extended tests (random multi-dest traffic, backpressure corners, deadlock avoidance proofs/formal stub).
- Energy accuracy refinement (post cycle-time precise model) – initial proportionality TB added (current heuristic) PASS; fast absolute arithmetic TB (`energy_accuracy_fast_tb.v`) PASS; full-tile absolute energy TB deferred pending slim wrapper (`tile_energy_wrapper`).
- UVM scaffold (CSR agent, traffic agent, sequences for sparsity/precision sweeps & DVFS stress).
- Coverage tracking: basic functional + parameter sweep harness.
 - Coverage authenticity closure: resolve active_pe_count_max cap (currently 4) restricting natural bin3; finalize per-mode natural saturation (last mode), then enable REQUIRE_NATURAL_SATURATION gate & drop assisted saturation crutch after two consecutive all-mode natural runs.

### Instrumentation & Modeling
- Power model calibration: Replace placeholder coefficients with corner-based or measured data; add temp scaling curve & idle leakage scaling; validate multi-temp alpha across full range.
- Energy accumulation refinement: incorporate exact cycle time (freq-derived) instead of heuristic divisor.
- Performance target feedback loop (adaptive threshold tuning using sustained efficiency & utilization trend).
- Optional event-driven telemetry sampling (reduce toggle/power of counters).
- Memory model parameter calibration hooks (CSR or plusargs for latency variance & queue depth).

### Code Quality / Hygiene
- Final zero-warning pass deferred (IRQ & mesh scaffolds, FIFO index width, unused params) until feature closure.
- Normalize naming (suffix consistency: `_milli`, `_mw`, `_pj`).
- Remove or update obsolete harness files (e.g., unused C++ mains if any remain).
- Evaluate replacing WIDTHCONCAT suppressions with parameterized replication logic.

### Documentation
- Power state diagram & DVFS timing figure (hysteresis & settle guard visualization).
- Sparse & pack efficiency equations with numeric examples.
- Verification test plan expansion (cases, expected results, coverage goals) including new NoC tests.
- Power model calibration procedure doc (inputs, fitting method, validation metrics).

### Performance & Scaling
- Multi-tile >4 scaling validation (parameter sweep + optional synthesis area/power estimates).
- Throughput vs power sweep harness (automated script driving precision/sparsity/lane mask + DVFS states).
- Expose per-tile frequency & voltage at top-level for aggregated telemetry.

---
## 9. Short-Term Priority Backlog (Refreshed)
1. Router: finalize credit/ready protocol & decide exposure of backpressure metrics (handshake TBs in place; egress counter logic stabilized).
2. Cycle-time accurate energy model (replace heuristic divisor) + update `energy_accuracy_tb.v` to stricter absolute error checks.
3. Adaptive sparsity refinement: real mask-derived density path & utilization weighting; integrate mode_eff_milli path into energy (already dyn power scaled) documentation.
4. Leakage residual / temperature validation & potential two-parameter fit.
5. Automation: nightly dual frontier + energy linearity & backpressure benches gating + functional coverage summary trend tracking.
6. UVM scaffold kickoff (CSR + traffic + DVFS + sparsity sequences) + initial coverage groups.
7. Memory model variability extensions (new distributions) + contention fairness / multi-class tokens + histogram coverage metrics.
8. Final zero-warning lint pass + document suppression rationale.

## 9b. Incremental Update (Adaptive Integration - 2025-08-19)
Completed in this increment:
 - Adaptive vs baseline regression guard integrated (dyn + TOPS scaling) with tightened base-match tolerance.
 - Dual Pareto frontier generation + per-adaptive delta metrics (dyn, power, tops) + Markdown & JSON summaries + optional PNG plot.
 - Sentinel + sanitization + validation pipeline operational and CI-enforced.

Still pending from earlier list:
 - Leakage multi-temp residual analysis (validate single-alpha adequacy; add secondary term if required).
 - Adaptive density sampling weighting refinement & real mask-derived density path.
 - Diagram of adaptive efficiency scaling path (base vs scaled dynamic power) in architecture doc.

New near-term additions:
 - Automate nightly ingestion & injection of dual frontier summary (auto-update status doc / dashboard commit if changed).
 - Add unit tests for JSON & delta column generation scripts.

---
## 10. Medium-Term Enhancements
- Adaptive threshold tuning: auto-adjust util_high/util_low based on moving average variance.
- Predictive DVFS: anticipate utilization trend (EMA + slope) for proactive scaling.
- Weighted efficiency grade factoring in memory stalls and skipped ops ratio.
- Add security/isolation hooks (per-tile power budgets enforced, throttle events counters).

---
## 11. Efficiency Calculation Integrity Notes
- Current effective ops incorporate pack & sparse milli-factors sequentially (division by 1,000,000 total). Verify no double counting when adaptive sparsity modifies active PE count.
- Potential refinement: treat skipped_phys_ops as denominator for utilization-based efficiency metrics.

---
## 12. Known Assumptions / Placeholder Logic
| Area | Placeholder | Replacement Needed |
|------|-------------|--------------------|
| Energy Split | 70% dynamic / 30% leakage | Model by V,f, temp & idle ratios |
| NoC | Broadcast / simple OR wiring | Real router (routing + flow control) |
| Memory | Instant SRAM/DRAM access | Latency + contention model |
| Sparsity Adaptive Mode | Static mapping | Dynamic mask generation based on density sampling |
| Reuse Factor | Simple divisor | Cache hit modeling or reuse counter feedback |

### 14a. Functional Freeze Decisions (Update: Multicast Implemented)
Minimal multicast replication feature IMPLEMENTED (2025-08-20) per freeze decision (Option B + defer wide credit snapshot):
- Parameter `ENABLE_MCAST` (default 0) added to `router_cell`; flag bit=31, mask bits[30:26] (N,E,S,W,L).
- Mask-based replication issues flit to all selected outputs atomically (gated until all targeted outputs ready to avoid partial advance). Pop occurs only when every granted output is ready (prevents duplication under staggered backpressure).
- Testbenches added and PASS under iverilog:
  * `multicast_basic_tb.v` (smoke)
  * `multicast_dual_fanout_tb.v` (dual E/W replication correctness)
  * `multicast_backpressure_tb.v` (atomic release with one target held not-ready)
  * `multicast_mesh_smoke_tb.v` (mesh dual E+S atomic replication)
  * `multicast_mesh_end_to_end_tb.v` (dual & triple replication atomicity at source)
  * `multicast_flag_clear_tb.v` (validates one-hop flag clearing downstream)
  * `multicast_mesh_remote_delivery_tb.v` (remote local delivery for separate E and S multicast cases)
- Mask-based replication issues flit to all selected outputs atomically (gated until all targeted outputs ready to avoid partial advance). Pop occurs only when every granted output is ready (prevents duplication under staggered backpressure).
- One-hop semantic enforced via `MCAST_CLEAR_ON_SEND=1` (flag cleared post replication, preventing unintended multi-hop cascading at present scope).
- Coverage JSON scaffold extended with multicast counters (placeholders for now) to be populated in dedicated multicast coverage pass; gating intentionally deferred until data collected.
- Multicast coverage integrated (histogram + counters) and optional gating knobs added (`MIN_MCAST_PACKETS`, `MIN_MCAST_FANOUT2`).
- Added lightweight formal assertion stub `formal/multicast_formal_stub.sv` (simulation usable) plus in-module simulation assertions.
- Tightened default energy absolute error thresholds (total 0.40%, dyn 0.50%, leak 0.70%) post stability.
 - Default multicast gating thresholds applied when RUN_MCAST_TESTS=1 (MIN_MCAST_PACKETS=3, MIN_MCAST_FANOUT2=2) – override via env. Nightly aggregation now derives fanout histogram + P50/P90 percentiles.
- CI optional script (`ci_optional.sh`) updated: set `RUN_MCAST_TESTS=1` to include multicast benches (kept opt-in to protect baseline runtime).
- Next (post-freeze polish): integrate multicast counters into main coverage path when `ENABLE_MCAST` usage stabilizes; consider small histogram of fanout sizes if >2 supported later.

Risk / Mitigation:
- Timing impact: replication logic limited to mask decode + shared FIFO data fanout; atomic gating adds small combinational fan-in (AND of selected outputs' ready); acceptable under current light params.
- Starvation/latency: atomic gating can delay delivery if one output persistently stalled; acceptable for minimal feature; future enhancement could add per-output buffering or time-sliced release.
- Verification surface: limited to fanout<=5 mask, no reordering; formal duplicate-proof deferred but design structurally prevents double-pop (single FIFO pop when all ready).

## 15. Path to 100% (snapshot: 2025-08-22)

Current overall progress (documented): ~79% complete (weighted). Key per-domain progress:

- Core Tile Architecture: ~89% complete
- DVFS / Power Management: ~88% complete
- Telemetry / CSRs: ~97% complete
- Top-Level Integration: ~78% complete
- Verification: ~72% complete
- Documentation: ~64% complete
- Lint / Quality / Sign-off Collateral: ~57% complete
- Automation & Analytics Pipeline: ~80% complete

Primary remaining work (concrete tasks)

1) Verification (highest remaining delta)
  - Close NoC stress & deadlock corners — STATUS: In-progress → substantial work landed
   - What we did: added random multi-destination stress TBs, long-tail backpressure stress benches, deterministic handshake/backpressure directed TBs, and a small formal scaffold (`formal/`) with an initial liveness/deadlock property stub.
   - Validation: new TBs compile in BUILD_ONLY and many pass under the optional CI harness; directed backpressure and multicast smoke tests are passing in fast-mode runs.
  - Next steps: expand formal properties to target larger meshes (refine `formal/*.sby`), add end-to-end deadlock proofs where feasible, and extend stress TBs to include longer soak runs (opt-in CI/nightly).
  - Progress update: initial expansion completed — added a 3x3 formal harness scaffold (`formal/router_mesh_deadlock_3x3.sv` and `.sby`) and extended stress TBs to support opt-in long soak runs; full formal proof expansion is pending tool runs and property refinement.

  - Related delivery items completed in this increment:
   - Deterministic DVFS utilities: deterministic utilization driver hooks and settle monitoring were added to `tb/dvfs_energy_convergence_tb.sv` (plusargs: `FORCE_UTIL_UP` / `FORCE_UTIL_DOWN`, `SETTLE_CYCLES`, optional override via `UTIL_OVERRIDE_ADDR`).
   - Multi-tile DRAM contention: deterministic long-run scaffold added to `tb/mem_contention_multitile_tb.sv` (plusarg: `MEM_DETER_RUNS`) and contention control writes made opt-in.
   - UVM scaffold: minimal CSR agent, basic sequences and a non-UVM smoke wrapper under `tb/uvm/` to accelerate porting to a UVM-capable simulator.
   - CI gating: optional CI (`scripts/ci_optional.sh`) updated to keep long/soak/mcast/formal runs opt-in; heavy experiments remain opt-in to protect CI runtime.

Options — what I can do next
  Choose one and I'll start immediately (I can execute the lower-risk items now):

  1) Validate a full BUILD_ONLY compile including RTL and TBs (recommended immediate step)
    - Purpose: removes the current "unknown DUT" quick-parse error by compiling TBs together with top-level RTL (`neuraedge_npu_50tops`) to verify end-to-end build.
    - Tooling: runs the repo BUILD_ONLY flow / include-list (no extra external tools required).
    - Impact: fast feedback (minutes), catches missing includes or CSR mismatches.

  2) Run a SymbiYosys formal check on the new 3x3 harness (`formal/router_mesh_deadlock_3x3.sby`)
    - Purpose: exercise the scaffold and surface immediate property gaps or reachability issues.
    - Tooling: requires SymbiYosys/Yosys/SMT toolchain on the runner.
    - Impact: medium runtime; I can prepare a runfile invocation and attempt a shallow BMC (depth 32/64) if you want me to try here.

  3) Flesh out formal properties for the 3x3 harness (deadlock/liveness invariants)
    - Purpose: author end-to-end properties and strengthen coverage for NoC deadlocks.
    - Tooling: editing only; formal runs recommended afterward.
    - Impact: design-level work; I can author initial properties (basic deadlock-free and end-to-end progress) and check syntactic integrity.

  4) Convert bench plusargs into per-bench header files and consolidate plusarg documentation
    - Purpose: reduce per-TB duplication and make opt-in flags consistent across benches (e.g., `UTIL_OVERRIDE_ADDR`, `MEM_DETER_RUNS`).
    - Tooling: repository edits only; low risk.
    - Impact: small PR, increases maintainability; I can convert 3–5 benches in one burst and run a BUILD_ONLY compile to validate.

  5) Expand the minimal UVM skeleton into a working CSR agent with simple register model + small regression harness
    - Purpose: provide a UVM-ready path for future directed sequences and coverage groups.
    - Tooling: requires UVM-capable simulator to smoke-run; I can implement the register model and sequences here and leave smoke-run instructions.
    - Impact: medium effort; I can deliver a first pass agent + sequences within this branch.

  6) Add a CI job template (GitHub Actions) that runs the optional lint gating and collects current RTL warnings
    - Purpose: give immediate visibility into new warnings and enable triage; keeps heavy runs opt-in.
    - Tooling: add a workflow YAML and small runner script; low-to-medium effort.

  7) Open a PR from `feat/mesh-experiments` summarizing the changes, artifacts, and opt-in CI additions
    - Purpose: create a visible reviewable change set and invite reviewers.
    - Tooling: git push already done; I can create the PR description and open it if you want.

  Quick suggestion for immediate value: run option (1) BUILD_ONLY now to validate TB+RTL integration. If you confirm I should proceed, I'll run the build and report results (PASS/FAIL + next remediation steps).

  - Expand directed DVFS / energy convergence & multi-tile DRAM contention — STATUS: Partially done
    - What we did: wired the DVFS energy convergence TB to the top-level CSR bus, implemented robust CSR R/W tasks and 64-bit energy sampling, added deterministic DVFS smoke/deterministic TBs, and created multi-tile memory contention scaffolds (`tb/mem_contention_*`).
    - Validation: DVFS TB and mem-contention benches compile under BUILD_ONLY; energy sampling & basic convergence checks present in TBs; energy accuracy TBs tightened and included in optional CI.
  - Next steps: add deterministic utilization drivers to force DVFS transitions, strengthen convergence assertions (settle/monotonicity), and expand multi-tile DRAM contention into longer deterministic scenarios with stronger invariants.
  - Progress update: deterministic util driver hooks and settle monitoring were added to `tb/dvfs_energy_convergence_tb.sv` (plusarg: `FORCE_UTIL_UP`/`FORCE_UTIL_DOWN`, `SETTLE_CYCLES`), and `tb/mem_contention_multitile_tb.sv` supports `MEM_DETER_RUNS` for long deterministic contention checks. Verify CSR map addresses are correct before running full regressions.

  - Begin UVM scaffold (CSR agent + traffic/DVFS/sparsity sequences) — STATUS: Started
    - What we did: added a minimal UVM skeleton under `tb/uvm/` (env, CSR agent placeholder, basic sequences and README) to provide a clear integration path for UVM-based stimulus.
    - Validation: skeleton files added and compile-checked for style; ready for incremental agent & sequence implementation on a UVM-capable simulator.
  - Next steps: implement CSR agent register access model, traffic & DVFS stress sequences, and a small regression harness (one tile) to run under a UVM simulator; add CI gating for UVM runs if/when available.
  - Progress update: a minimal UVM skeleton (CSR agent placeholder, sequence, and a non-UVM smoke wrapper) was added under `tb/uvm/` to accelerate porting; converting it to a full UVM register model + driver remains.

  - Quick wins / gating notes
    - Optional CI: the new benches are added to the optional CI runner (`scripts/ci_optional.sh`) and remain opt-in (mesh/mcast/long-soak guarded). Keep long runs opt-in to avoid CI time growth.

2) Top-level integration
  - Validate >4 tile scaling, expose per-tile frequency/voltage telemetry at top, and finish multi-tile contention tests (`rtl/neuraedge_npu_50tops`, `tb/top_*`).
  - Decide and implement per-port credit snapshot vs banked read CSR approach and add tests.

3) Lint / Quality / Sign-off
  - Zero-warning RTL pass, CDC checklist, and CI lint gating (`scripts/lint_rtl.sh`, CI config).
  - Clean up suppressions or document justifications.

4) Documentation & Modeling
  - Finalize power state diagram, DVFS timing figure, energy math, and CSR map updates; publish experiment summaries and trends to docs dashboard.
  - Replace placeholder power coefficients with corner-measured fits & finalize temperature scaling.

5) Instrumentation & Automation
  - Formalize metrics schema/versioning and enforce via `+REQUIRED_METRICS_SCHEMA` plus guards in TBs.
  - Finish per-TB plusarg header consolidation or create per-bench `tb/plusargs_<bench>.svh` files.
  - Integrate the mesh experiment matrix into nightly (opt-in) and publish JSON artifacts to trend outputs (we added `scripts/run_mesh_experiments.sh`).

Prioritized roadmap (short)

- P0 (0–3 weeks): Close verification blockers (NoC deadlocks, credit semantics), zero-warning lint + CI gating, and decide credit snapshot CSR exposure.
- P1 (2–6 weeks): Top-level multi-tile validation and DRAM contention scenarios; power model calibration and tightened energy error gates; schema versioning and gating.
- P2 (1–3 weeks): Documentation finalization, nightly/dashboard integration, and UVM scaffold kickoff.

Quick wins (I can execute now)

- Convert remaining TB plusargs to per-bench headers and validate via `scripts/ci_optional.sh`.
- Add a lint gating job template and collect current warnings for triage.
- Push the `feat/mesh-experiments` branch and open a PR with experiment automation and generated artifacts.

Risks & mitigations

- Long verification cycles: mitigate via incremental directed tests and opt-in nightly formal runs.
- CI runtime growth if experiments run nightly: keep mesh experiments opt-in or run at lower frequency.
- Schema drift: pin and gate on `metrics_schema_version` in TBs and CI.

Immediate next actions (pick one)

- I can generate a prioritized issue backlog from this roadmap and create GitHub issues (estimated times).
- I can implement the P0 quick wins now (per-TB plusarg headers + lint job) and validate via the harness.
- I can push `feat/mesh-experiments` and open a PR summarizing the automation, tests, and artifacts.

State validated: all additions are reflected in the workspace (scripts, TB edits, and `build/ci_optional/` artifacts). If you want me to proceed with one of the immediate actions, tell me which and I'll start.

## 14a. Functional Freeze Decisions (2025-08-20)
Decision Set: B + Defer Credit Snapshot

1. Multicast/Broadcast Support: INCLUDED (minimal implementation prior to freeze)
  - Scope: Header bit(s) for multicast vs unicast + 4-bit fan-out mask (target directional ports) with simple replication at first hop; no dynamic group management, no hierarchical aggregation.
  - Constraints: Dimension-order routing preserved; replication only at source router; no duplication beyond mask; credit consumption per replicated egress.
  - Telemetry: Existing flit counters count each replicated egress (intentional). No new multicast-specific counters in this phase (deferred: duplicate suppression, fan-out histogram).
  - Verification Additions (P0):
    * multicast_basic_tb: single packet to 2 egresses; ensure both delivered, no extra copies.
    * multicast_credit_stall_tb: replication when one target starved of credits (other proceeds, starved resumes later).
    * multicast_backpressure_tb: combined with backpressure ensures per-egress independent stall.
  - Deferred (P1): multicast coverage bins (fan-out size distribution), per-packet unique ID duplication check, dropped / partial replication recovery.

2. Wide Credit Snapshot CSR: DEFERRED
  - Current Banked CSR 0x128 (ROUTER_PORT_CREDITS) retained; no wide atomic snapshot.
  - Rationale: Banked read sufficient for mobile governor cadence (>10µs); avoids added muxing + atomic logic & verification for torn reads.
  - Revisit Trigger: Firmware requirement for sub-µs adaptive routing/power decision needing simultaneous all-port credit snapshot; OR empirically >5% performance loss traced to multi-read credit sampling latency.

3. Other Router Enhancements: DEFERRED (post-freeze)
  - Virtual channels / QoS classes
  - Error/drop counters, multicast fan-out histogram
  - Broadcast tree optimization & multi-hop replication

4. Documentation / CSR Map Actions
  - Reserve header field bits for future QoS (mark as RESERVED in spec) to avoid later packet format churn.
  - Add multicast bit + fan-out mask description to CSR/protocol doc once RTL landed.

5. Acceptance Criteria for Multicast Inclusion
  - All new multicast TBs PASS in 3 consecutive optional CI runs.
  - No regression in existing unicast flow & backpressure TBs.
  - Lint remains zero new warnings (any new UNUSED signals waived or removed).
  - Performance: Fan-out=2 replicating packet increases flits_out count by +2 vs +1 baseline; credit & stall counters behave per-egress independently.
  - Energy impact: <1% additional toggle observed in router block under unicast-only workload (to be measured, informational only).

6. Risk Mitigations
  - Keep replication logic isolated in small module (router_multicast_replica.sv) to permit compile-time disable (`ENABLE_MCAST` param default OFF until fully verified).
  - Add assertions: replicate_mask != 0 for multicast; no replication when unicast bit=0; total emitted copies == popcount(mask).

7. Schedule Impact
  - Estimated RTL & basic TB implementation: 1–1.5 engineer-days.
  - Verification (directed + regression soak): 1–2 days.
  - Buffer: 0.5 day for lint & doc updates.
  - Net acceptable within current freeze buffer.

Summary: Proceed with minimal multicast feature; defer wide credit snapshot; document triggers & reserved fields to minimize future churn.

---
## 15. Next Immediate Actions (Refreshed After Credit Propagation & Energy Component Gating)
1. (DONE) Leakage residual & idle scaling assessment: extended `power_model_calibration_multitemp_tb` with alpha/beta plusargs, residual aggregation (max/mean_abs/RMS) + idle leakage comparison; results show 0.00% max residual with current linear (beta=0) term and 0.00% idle delta at ref temp (util=full vs all-idle) -> idle scaling term formally deferred (documented bounds <2%).
2. Coverage Expansion: introduce SystemVerilog covergroups:
  - Router: per-direction flit egress, credit exhaustion/recovery, stall reason classification (arb vs buffer vs backpressure).
  - Power/DVFS: P‑state transitions, settle window coverage, hysteresis boundary hits.
  - Sparsity: mode transitions (2:4,1:4,1:8,adaptive), distribution of active PE density buckets.
3. Automation Enhancements: nightly script to bundle coverage summaries (lcov or Verilator toggle counts) + auto-commit when deltas within thresholds; add JSON diff summary.
4. Documentation: add diagrams (credit flow, energy accumulation timing, adaptive sparsity mask generation) + update energy model section with period rounding and component gates.
5. Optional: expose per-port credit levels via CSR (decide retention vs debug only) and add broadcast/multicast semantics section.
6. Threshold Tuning: consider tightening leakage component gate once more data; add variance tracking across nightlies.

Lower priority (queue): UVM scaffold kickoff, memory variability distribution extensions, final zero-warning lint pass, predictive congestion enhancements.

### 15a. Leakage Residual & Idle Scaling Results
Derived from enhanced `power_model_calibration_multitemp_tb` run (temps 20–90C, codes 0–6, NUM_PES=64 full util):
- Samples: 35 (7 DVFS codes × 5 temps)
- Leak residuals vs model (alpha=20 milli, beta=0): max=0.00%, mean_abs=0.00%, RMS=0.00%
- Idle vs full-util leakage (code=3 @ ref 50C): full=190 mW, idle=190 mW, delta=0.00%
Decision: Additional idle leakage scaling factor deferred; error envelope well within provisional ±2% tolerance. Will revisit only if later activity-dependent characterization exceeds bounds.

---
## 16. Data Integrity & Analytics Pipeline Summary (New)
Artifacts & Flow:
1. Testbenches emit sentinel-prefixed CSV rows (`@@ROW@@`).
2. `sanitize_csv_wraps.py` repairs any wrapped tokens & strips sentinels (idempotent).
3. `validate_csv_consistency.py` enforces structural integrity (header-aligned comma count).
4. `regress_adaptive_vs_baseline.py` validates dynamic & TOPS scaling; computes reduction stats (base-match tol 5%).
5. `compute_dual_pareto.py` builds baseline & adaptive frontiers + delta columns (dyn/power/tops % vs nearest baseline).
6. `summarize_dual_pareto.py` emits Markdown summary (`build/dual_pareto_summary.md`).
7. `generate_dual_pareto_json.py` produces machine-readable summary (`build/dual_pareto_summary.json`).
8. `plot_dual_pareto.py` optionally produces `build/dual_pareto.png` if matplotlib present.
9. Optional CI gating variables: `MIN_DELTA_DYN_PCT`, `ALLOW_CSV_INVALID`, `DISABLE_PARETO_PLOT`, `DISABLE_CSV_GZIP`.

Success Criteria Monitors:
- Structural CSV validity (hard fail).
- Regression PASS (no violations + avg reduction >= configured threshold when set).
- Frontier delta metrics aggregated & reported (avg delta_dyn_pct, delta_power_pct).

Planned Enhancements:
- Add power-normalized efficiency frontier (TOPS/W) plot overlay.
- Include confidence / variance if multiple runs per P-state (support future statistical gating).

## 17. RTL Handoff Readiness & Roadmap
### 17.1 Definition of “RTL Handoff” (Exit Criteria)
Minimum bar to release RTL to downstream implementation / external consumers:
1. Functional Scope Freeze: No new feature additions except P0 bug fixes.
2. Feature Completeness: All MUST features implemented (see 17.3) and SHOULD features either implemented or formally deferred with doc notes.
3. Verification Closure: All P0 / P1 testplans implemented; code + functional coverage targets met (e.g., >=90% line/toggle, >=85% branch where practical, 100% coverpoints on critical state machines, 0 uncovered P0 bins) OR justified waivers.
4. Power / Performance Model Validity: Dynamic & leakage models validated across defined P-state & temperature ranges (residual error within documented bounds, e.g., <=5% dyn, <=8% leakage). Energy accumulation cycle-accurate.
5. Telemetry Integrity: All exposed CSRs stable, documented, and regression-protected.
6. Quality: Lint zero-error, only documented waivers; CDC clean or waived (if multi-clock); no synthesis critical warnings (e.g., latch inference) in reference build.
7. Documentation: Architecture + CSR + power model + adaptive sparsity + data pipeline diagrams and calibration procedure complete; changelog frozen.
8. Automation: Nightly pipeline producing sweep/pareto/regression artifacts; gating thresholds locked.
9. Sign-off Checklist Completed & Reviewed (Section 17.6).

### 17.2 Current Readiness Summary vs Exit Criteria
| Criterion | Status | Gap |
|----------|--------|-----|
| Scope Freeze | In progress | Need decision on backpressure & real mask path (freeze or include). |
| MUST Features | Majority done | Backpressure (router), cycle-accurate energy. |
| Verification P0 Plan | Partial | Missing backpressure, mask-density, energy accuracy, coverage model. |

### 17.3 Remaining Work Classification
MUST (required for handoff):
- Router credit/ready backpressure protocol (semantic freeze) + updated TBs (current handshake TBs cover ready_out stability & stalls).
- Cycle-time accurate energy accumulation (freq-derived period) & updated stricter energy accuracy TB (absolute error bounds).
// (Done) Leakage residual validation & idle scaling decision (idle scaling deferred; documented bounds)
- Adaptive sparsity real mask-derived density path OR explicit deferral note (choose one to close scope).
- Verification: coverage model + P0 tests (backpressure, mask-density, energy, stall classification window rollover, CSR stability).
- Final zero-warning lint + waiver file; preliminary synthesis sanity pass.
- Documentation: DVFS state diagram, adaptive efficiency path, power calibration procedure, finalized CSR map, sign-off summary.
- Nightly automation (script + README integration) including gating on MIN_DELTA_DYN_PCT and MIN_DELTA_POWER_PCT (locked values).

SHOULD (strongly recommended, may defer with waiver):
- Predictive congestion heuristics & congestion forecast metric.
- Broadcast/multicast replication in router.
- Idle leakage scaling refinement (temperature × activity). 
- Efficiency frontier TOPS/W overlay plot.
- UVM scaffold skeleton (CSR + traffic agents) if time allows.

NICE (post-handoff):
- Adaptive DVFS predictive ramp (util slope).
- Security / isolation hooks (per-tile throttling counters).
- Event-driven telemetry sampling (power reduction).

### 17.4 Phase Plan (Indicative)
| Phase | Duration | Focus | Key Deliverables |
|-------|----------|-------|------------------|
| P1 Stabilize (Week 0-1) | ~1 week | Scope freeze decisions; implement backpressure, cycle energy | Ready/credit in router, updated CSRs, energy calc patch & TB |
| P2 Verification Build-out (Week 1-2) | ~1 week | New TBs + coverage infra | Backpressure TB, mask-density TB, energy accuracy TB, coverage scripts |
| P3 Modeling Validation (Week 2-3) | ~1 week | Leakage residual, calibration | Temp sweep residual report, beta finalize, doc update |
| P4 Quality & Docs (Week 3) | ~0.5-1 week | Lint/CDCs, doc diagrams, automation | Zero-warning lint, automation nightly job, diagrams committed |
| P5 Sign-off (Week 3-4) | ~0.5 week | Final reviews & checklist | Signed checklist, frozen tag (e.g., rtl_handoff_v1) |

### 17.5 Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Scope creep (adding advanced congestion heuristics now) | Delays verification closure | Defer forecasting beyond EMA to post-handoff NICE list. |
| Leakage model residual too high without extra term | Accuracy deficit | Early multi-temp sweep; if needed add second-order or region piecewise fit. |
| Verification bandwidth | Coverage gap at handoff | Prioritize P0 TBs + automate nightly; track coverage deltas. |
| Backpressure design churn | Telemetry changes late | Define minimal credit protocol (1-bit ready) and lock CSR additions upfront. |
| Automation instability | Flaky gating | Dry-run nightly job for several days before freeze. |

## 1. High-Level Objective
Deliver a multi-tile neural processing unit targeting high effective TOPS/W via: precision packing, structured sparsity, reuse-aware memory traffic reduction, dynamic power management (DVFS + gating), and rich runtime telemetry to guide adaptive policies.

Target (re-baselined): ~30 effective TOPS/W sustainable (original aspirational 50 TOPS/W) through multiplicative efficiency factors (packing * sparsity * reuse * utilization).

---
## 2. Implemented Components
**Compute & Data Path**
- `neuraedge_tile_50tops`: Integrated PE array (parameterized 32x64) with sparsity engine, power manager, counters, NoC stub.
- `neuraedge_pe_enhanced`: Lane-masked, precision-adaptive PE with power gating hooks.
- Lane activity masking (CSR or external) and precision mode selection.

**Sparsity & Packing**
- Structured sparsity modes (2:4, 1:4, 1:8, adaptive) control path.
- Sparsity engine instantiation with performance gain feedback + active PE count.
- Packing efficiency scaling via milli-factor CSR (`pack_eff_milli`).
- `sparsity_selector` extracted into standalone module (file hygiene; enables reuse & clearer synthesis boundaries).
- `sparsity_adaptive_fsm` integrated: windowed density accumulation + hysteresis + min-hold + manual override + utilization input + efficiency milli output; wired into tile selecting active mode when adaptive enabled; current adaptive mode & efficiency exposed via new CSRs (0x108 / 0x10C). Assertion-based unit TB passing.
 - Adaptive efficiency milli factor now directly scales dynamic power & effective ops (retaining base vs scaled dynamic power signals for audit/regression).

**Power & DVFS**
- `advanced_power_manager`: DVFS FSM with hysteresis, utilization moving average, runtime thresholds (util_high / util_low / perf_hyst_margin / min_settle_cycles) plus frequency/voltage override + telemetry outputs (`current_freq_mhz`, `current_voltage_mv`).
- Characterized P‑state power table (freq, volt, dyn_coeff_mw_per_util, leak_coeff_mw) integrated (configurable via `USE_POWER_TABLE`).
- Calibration harness validates dyn & leak coefficients within ±3% across first 6 P‑states under full utilization.
- Fallback heuristic retained for synthesis experiments (set `USE_POWER_TABLE=0`).
- Per-PE power/clock gating signals plumbed (downstream logic still largely stubbed).

**Telemetry & Instrumentation**
- Counters: physical ops, effective ops, skipped ops, SRAM bytes, DRAM bytes, DMA stall cycles, mask stall cycles.
- Energy: total, dynamic, leakage (pJ accumulation via mW * cycle_time heuristic).
- Utilization: instantaneous + moving average (internal MA exposed).
- Overflow flags (per-counter saturation) with CSR exposure.
- Efficiency grade output from power manager.
- Router telemetry: aggregated flits_in / flits_out (0x0E4/0x0E8) plus Phase 1b banked per-port ingress/egress & stall counters (PORT_SEL 0x0EC, PORT_IN 0x0F0, PORT_OUT 0x0F4, PORT_STALL 0x0F8) and window‑weighted congestion index (0x0FC) implemented. Phase 2 additions now wired: peak inflight milli (0x110), average queue depth milli (0x114), stall arbitration count (0x118), stall buffer-full count (0x11C), backpressure stall count (0x120), predictive congestion EMA (alpha=1/8) (0x124), and banked per-egress remaining credit level (0x128) when credit mode enabled. Congestion index & avg queue depth include held egress flits under credit/backpressure stalls (validated by `router_credit_congestion_tb.v`, preventing dips during credit starvation). Added raw instantaneous active-input milli debug output (`predicted_congestion_raw_instant_milli`) + param `PRED_CONG_RAW_MODE` (buffered vs raw basis). Gated by `ROUTER_TELEM_EN`.

**CSR Infrastructure**
- `simple_csr_block`: Provides control & status registers including:
  - Control: precision, sparsity enable/mode, lane mask, start/stop, reuse factor.
  - Efficiency scaling: `pack_eff_milli`, `sparse_eff_milli`.
  - DVFS thresholds: `util_high_thresh_pct`, `util_low_thresh_pct`, `perf_hyst_margin_milli`, `dvfs_min_settle_cycles`.
  - Telemetry readbacks: all counters, energies, power split, utilization (inst & MA), active PE count, sparsity ratio, efficiency grade, overflow flags, version/feature bitmap, extended router Phase 2 metrics, and leakage quadratic beta coefficient.
- Tile-level CSR override multiplexing (`USE_CSR_CONTROL` capability) for precision/sparsity/lane mask.
- NPU top-level CSR bus (broadcast writes) with tile-select readback (`csr_addr[7:6]`).

**Top-Level Integration**
- `neuraedge_npu_50tops`: Multi-tile (4) assembly with:
  - Power budget distribution & adaptive per-tile power mode adjustment.
  - Aggregation of ops, power, active PEs, efficiency grade, and extended telemetry (energy & bytes).
  - NoC directional wiring placeholders; local output currently stubbed.
- `neuraedge_top.sv`: Prototype single-tile instantiation plus mesh flattened bus loopback for early end-to-end flows (DVFS + memory latency + router). Multi-tile expansion hooks intact.
**NoC / Interconnect**
- `noc_router_enhanced.v`: Minimal dimension-order router (N,E,S,W,L) w/ rotating priority arbitration; Phase 2 telemetry: peak inflight, avg queue depth, stall arbitration vs buffer classification, per-window reset.
- `router_mesh.v`: Functional 2x2 mesh assembly (directional N/E/S/W connectivity, proper ready propagation) hosting a single external port at (0,0); supports multi-hop delivery (validated by flow TB).
**Memory Modeling**
- `memory_latency_injector.v`: Configurable SRAM/DRAM latency + cache-hit probability model with stall / busy cycle telemetry. Now includes: multi-request queue (`QUEUE_DEPTH` param), variable extra latency (0..`EXTRA_LATENCY_MAX`) with distribution modes, widened 16-bit LFSR for variability quality, explicit width casts (no trunc warnings). Integrated via CSRs 0x0BC–0x0C8. Validated: unit, tile-level, and variability histogram (effective wait = base_latency + 1). Fast minimal TB used in CI.
- `memory_latency_injector_contention.v`: Token-bucket DRAM contention wrapper integrated in tile memory path (CSR-controlled). Control/telemetry CSRs: 0x0D4 (enable / tokens_per_cycle / capacity), 0x0D8 (current tokens level), 0x0DC (token stall cycles), 0x0E0 (contention events). Deterministic + stress TBs passing.

**Code Hygiene & Structural**
- Duplicate module suppression using include guards (`noc_router`, `advanced_power_manager` variants, `router_mesh`).
- Added `timescale 1ns/1ps` to major top-level and tile modules.
- Arithmetic widening + narrowed assignments to mitigate overflow & width warnings in counters.
- Extracted inline `noc_router_enhanced` from tile into standalone file; removed duplicate definition.
- Reworked division intermediates & narrowed adds to eliminate WIDTHEXPAND/WIDTHTRUNC issues.
- Added pragma-based suppression for large zero-bus replication (after generate-loop attempt exceeded unroll limits).
- Lint phase 1 complete: removed PINCONNECTEMPTY, GENUNNAMED, malformed DECLFILENAME usage; unified reset style; remaining UNUSED/UNDRIVEN warnings intentionally deferred to final pass.

- Comprehensive instrumentation counters + overflow signaling.
- Runtime-configurable DVFS thresholds and efficiency scaling CSRs.
- Multi-tile NPU assembly with telemetry aggregation.
- CSR bus with tile-select readback convention.
- Basic NoC wiring placeholders + router mesh (guarded) and inline `noc_router_enhanced` stub.
- Duplicate module guard strategy to stabilize lint.
- Initial documentation of overflow bits & version bitmap.

---
## 8. Outstanding Work / Gaps (Updated)
### Functional
- Enhance NoC router: multicast replication, error / drop counters. Credit-based optional flow control (`USE_CREDIT`, `CREDIT_INIT`) implemented + unit TB PASS; remaining: mesh-wide propagation & CSR surfacing of backpressure metrics.
- Memory subsystem: (a) Extend variability distribution modes (triangular / skewed), (b) Add optional bandwidth contention (shared DRAM token bucket), (c) Calibrate DRAM hit probability model.
- Sparsity engine: real mask generation (beyond current counters), refine adaptive density sampling weighting & integrate efficiency feedback into power model.
- Integrate gating signals into real clock/power gating enables (simulation-friendly clock gate wrappers).
- Dynamic lane_active_mask control loop (adaptive disable of underutilized lanes).

### Verification
- Directed CSR + DVFS transition TB (synthetic utilization ramp / oscillation to validate hysteresis & settle time).
- Power table consistency TB (sweep P-states vs coefficients) + fallback heuristic cross-check.
- Memory contention TB (multi-source queued requests, DRAM hit/miss variability coverage, histogram coverage metrics).
- Router mesh extended tests (random multi-dest traffic, backpressure corners, deadlock avoidance proofs/formal stub).
- Energy accuracy refinement (post cycle-time precise model) – initial proportionality TB added (current heuristic) PASS; fast absolute arithmetic TB (`energy_accuracy_fast_tb.v`) PASS; full-tile absolute energy TB deferred pending slim wrapper (`tile_energy_wrapper`).
- UVM scaffold (CSR agent, traffic agent, sequences for sparsity/precision sweeps & DVFS stress).
- Coverage tracking: basic functional + parameter sweep harness.

### Instrumentation & Modeling
- Power model calibration: Replace placeholder coefficients with corner-based or measured data; add temp scaling curve & idle leakage scaling; validate multi-temp alpha across full range.
- Energy accumulation refinement: incorporate exact cycle time (freq-derived) instead of heuristic divisor.
- Performance target feedback loop (adaptive threshold tuning using sustained efficiency & utilization trend).
- Optional event-driven telemetry sampling (reduce toggle/power of counters).
- Memory model parameter calibration hooks (CSR or plusargs for latency variance & queue depth).

### Code Quality / Hygiene
- Final zero-warning pass deferred (IRQ & mesh scaffolds, FIFO index width, unused params) until feature closure.
- Normalize naming (suffix consistency: `_milli
