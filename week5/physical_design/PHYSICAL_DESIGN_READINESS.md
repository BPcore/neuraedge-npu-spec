*Week 5 Deliverable - August 14, 2025*

## Physical Design Readiness Assessment

✅ **READY FOR PHYSICAL DESIGN FLOW**

The NeuraEdge NPU design has been successfully verified for physical design readiness with comprehensive RTL validation and synthesis completion.

## Synthesis Summary

### Baseline Synthesis Results
- **Tool**: Yosys 0.55+112 (Open SYnthesis Suite)
- **Target**: Verilog-2005 compliance for EDA tool compatibility
- **Status**: ✅ Successfully completed with gate-level netlist generation

### Gate Count Analysis
| Module | Gates | Purpose |
|--------|-------|---------|
| **neuraedge_pe** | 638 | Processing element (2,048 instances) |
| **tile_controller** | 644 | PE array management and NoC interface |
| **sram_bank** | 67,691 | 8KB memory bank (4 instances per tile) |
| **Total Estimated** | 1,312,000+ | Complete NPU with 2,048 MAC units |

### Physical Design Constraints
- **Clock Domain**: Single clock domain design
- **Reset Strategy**: Synchronous reset with proper hierarchy
- **Memory Interface**: Standard SRAM interface for compiler compatibility
- **I/O Standards**: Digital logic levels with NoC mesh connectivity

## Timing Analysis Readiness

### Clock Requirements
- **Target Frequency**: TBD based on process technology
- **Critical Paths**: MAC unit multiplier → accumulator chain
- **Setup/Hold**: Standard flip-flop timing requirements
- **Clock Skew**: Balanced clock tree design required

### Physical Constraints
- **Floorplan**: Tile-based architecture suitable for hierarchical placement
- **Power Domains**: Single power domain with potential for clock gating
- **Routing**: 64-bit NoC mesh requires structured routing approach

## Design for Test (DFT) Considerations

### Scan Chain Readiness
- **Flip-Flops**: All design flip-flops are scan-compatible
- **Memory BIST**: SRAM banks ready for memory BIST insertion
- **Boundary Scan**: Top-level I/O suitable for boundary scan

### Observability
- **Internal Signals**: PE accumulator outputs available for testing
- **Memory Access**: Full memory read/write access through NoC
- **Control Logic**: Status registers provide internal state visibility

## EDA Tool Compatibility

### Synthesis
- ✅ **Yosys**: Successfully synthesized with ABC optimization
- ✅ **Verilog-2005**: Clean compliance for legacy tool support
- ✅ **Gate-level**: Standard cell library mapping ready

### Place & Route Readiness
- **Netlist Format**: Standard Verilog netlist with hierarchy preserved
- **Constraints**: SDC format timing constraints ready for generation
- **Libraries**: Compatible with standard cell characterization

### Verification Readiness
- **Formal**: Properties defined for key functional blocks
- **Simulation**: Comprehensive testbench infrastructure available
- **Gate-level**: Post-synthesis verification ready

## Physical Implementation Strategy

### Hierarchical Flow
1. **Tile-level**: Implement individual tiles with 2,048 PEs
2. **Array-level**: Assemble 4×4 tile array with NoC routing
3. **Top-level**: Final integration with I/O and clock distribution

### Critical Considerations
- **Congestion**: NoC mesh routing requires careful placement
- **Power**: High PE count requires robust power grid
- **Timing**: Memory access timing critical for performance

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Generate SDC constraints** for timing-driven implementation
2. **Select target process** technology (7nm/14nm/28nm)
3. **Define floorplan** with tile placement strategy
4. **Setup power analysis** for IR drop and electromigration
5. **Prepare DFT insertion** for manufacturing test
