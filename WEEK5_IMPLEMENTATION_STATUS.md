- `week5_signoff` - Complete sign-off package generation
- `week5_complete` - Master target for full Week 5 flow
- Automated documentation generation
- Complete handoff package in `build/week5_signoff_package/`

## üéØ Advanced Features Implemented

### Multi-Mode PPA Optimization
```makefile
PPA_MODES = baseline optimized timing_focused area_focused
```

### Configurable Targets
```makefile  
TARGET_FREQ = 100    # MHz - configurable
TARGET_AREA = 50000  # gates - configurable
```

### Comprehensive Reporting
- Synthesis logs for each mode
- Area and timing analysis
- QoR comparison reports
- Sign-off documentation

## üõ†Ô∏è Week 5 Workflow

### Complete Flow Execution
```bash
make week5_complete
```

### Individual Task Testing
```bash
make setup_week5           # Setup environment
make synth_baseline        # Baseline synthesis  
make synth_ppa_sweep      # Multi-mode optimization
make generate_constraints  # Timing constraints
make physical_synth_smoke # Physical synthesis test
make qor_report           # QoR analysis
make week5_signoff        # Sign-off package
```
