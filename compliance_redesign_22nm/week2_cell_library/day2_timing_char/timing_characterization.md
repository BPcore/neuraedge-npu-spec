# Timing Characterization @ 0.6V Operation

## Characterization Methodology

### Process Corners
```
SS (Slow-Slow): Worst-case timing
- Process: Slow NMOS, Slow PMOS
- Voltage: 0.54V (-10% derating)
- Temperature: 125°C
- Target: Hold time verification

TT (Typical-Typical): Nominal timing
- Process: Typical NMOS, Typical PMOS  
- Voltage: 0.6V (nominal)
- Temperature: 25°C
- Target: Performance verification

FF (Fast-Fast): Best-case timing
- Process: Fast NMOS, Fast PMOS
- Voltage: 0.66V (+10% derating)
- Temperature: -40°C
- Target: Setup time verification
```

### Critical Path Analysis
```
Target Frequency: 600MHz (1.67ns period)
Setup Margin: 200ps minimum
Hold Margin: 100ps minimum

Critical Path Categories:
1. PE computation paths (800ps target)
2. Memory access paths (600ps target)  
3. NoC router paths (400ps target)
4. Control logic paths (300ps target)
```

### Cell Timing Models
```
Liberty Format (.lib):
- Multi-dimensional lookup tables
- Input slew vs output load characterization
- Setup/hold constraint matrices
- Clock-to-Q propagation tables

Timing Constraints:
- Input transition: 50ps to 500ps
- Output load: 10fF to 2pF  
- Operating voltage: 0.54V to 0.66V
```
