# Power Characterization @ 0.6V Operation

## Power Analysis Methodology

### Power Components
```
Dynamic Power:
- Switching activity dependent
- Proportional to V²×f×C
- Dominant at high activity factors

Leakage Power:
- Voltage and temperature dependent  
- Exponential relationship with Vt
- Dominant in idle/retention modes

Short-Circuit Power:
- Input transition dependent
- Minimized with proper drive sizing
- Typically <5% of total power
```

### Characterization Setup
```
Operating Conditions:
- Voltage: 0.6V nominal
- Frequency: 600MHz
- Temperature: 25°C typical, 125°C worst-case
- Activity Factor: 25% typical, 50% worst-case

Power Simulation:
- VectorBased: Real application patterns
- Monte Carlo: Statistical power analysis
- Corner-based: Process variation impact
```

Low-Vt variants: 2.5x higher leakage, 15% lower dynamic
Ultra-Low-Vt: 8x higher leakage, 25% lower dynamic
```

### Memory Power Characterization
```
SRAM Banks (per kB @ 0.6V):
- Read Power: 85pW/MHz per kB
- Write Power: 120pW/MHz per kB  
- Leakage: 15pW per kB
- Retention (0.3V): 2pW per kB

Register Files (32x32b @ 0.6V):
- Read Power: 25pW/MHz
- Write Power: 35pW/MHz
- Leakage: 8pW
```

### Multi-Vt Optimization Strategy
```
Power/Performance Optimization:
1. Critical Paths: Low-Vt cells (15% of total)
2. Semi-Critical: Regular-Vt cells (60% of total)  
3. Non-Critical: High-Vt cells (25% of total)

Expected Power Reduction:
- All High-Vt: +40% delay, -60% leakage
- All Low-Vt: -25% delay, +250% leakage
- Optimized Mix: +5% delay, -35% leakage
```
