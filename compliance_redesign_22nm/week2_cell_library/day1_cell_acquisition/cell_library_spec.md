# TSMC 22nm FDX Cell Library Specification

## Required Cell Libraries

### Standard Cell Libraries
```
TCBN22FFXBWP0P72VM: High-Vt cells (0.72V nominal, 0.6V operation)
TCBN22FFXLVT0P72VM: Low-Vt cells (0.72V nominal, 0.6V operation)  
TCBN22FFXULVT0P72VM: Ultra-low-Vt cells (0.72V nominal, 0.6V operation)
TCBN22FFXRLVT0P72VM: Regular-low-Vt cells (balanced power/performance)

Operating Conditions:
- Voltage: 0.6V (derated from 0.72V nominal)
- Temperature: -40°C to 125°C
- Process: SS, TT, FF corners
```

### Memory Compiler Libraries
```
SRAM Compilers:
- TCBN22RFSPHVT: High-density SRAM (0.6V operation)
- TCBN22RFSPULVT: Ultra-low-voltage SRAM (0.45V retention)
- TCBN22RFDPHVT: Dual-port SRAM for multi-access

Register File Compilers:
- TCBN22RFRFHVT: High-density register files
- TCBN22RFRFULVT: Low-power register files
```

### I/O Libraries
```
I/O Cells:
- TPDN22FFX: 1.8V I/O cells (for external interface)
- TPDN22ULVT: Level shifters (0.6V core to 1.8V I/O)
- TPDN22ESD: ESD protection cells
```

## Characterization Requirements

### Timing Characterization
- Setup/hold times at 0.6V operation
- Propagation delays for critical paths
- Clock-to-Q delays for sequential elements
- Multi-corner analysis (SS/TT/FF)

### Power Characterization  
- Dynamic power at 600MHz switching
- Leakage power at 0.6V operation
- Power-down mode characterization
- DVFS power scaling curves

### Physical Characterization
- Cell heights and routing tracks
- Pin accessibility and routing rules
- Power grid requirements
- Area optimization factors
