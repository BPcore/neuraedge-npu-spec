# DVFS Implementation Plan for 0.6V Operation

## Voltage Scaling Implementation

### Voltage Regulator Requirements
```
Primary Regulator:
- Input: 1.8V (from system supply)
- Output: 0.45V - 0.80V (programmable)
- Resolution: 10 mV steps
- Settling Time: <10 μs
- Efficiency: >85% @ 0.6V
- Load Regulation: <2%

Secondary Regulators:
- Always-on: 0.6V fixed
- I/O Supply: 1.8V fixed  
- Analog: 1.8V (for PLLs)
- Reference: 1.2V (for ADCs)
```

### PLL and Clock Generation
```
Primary PLL:
- Input Reference: 25 MHz crystal
- VCO Range: 300 MHz - 1.6 GHz
- Output Dividers: /1, /2, /4, /8
- Target Frequencies: 300, 400, 600, 700, 800 MHz
- Jitter: <5 ps RMS @ 600 MHz

Clock Distribution:
- Global clock tree from PLL
- Local gating per functional unit
- Dynamic frequency scaling support
- Glitch-free frequency switching
```

### Power State Machine
```
Power States:
1. OFF: All domains powered down
2. RETENTION: Memory retention only
3. IDLE: Minimum power, clock gated
4. ACTIVE_LOW: 0.45V, 300 MHz
5. ACTIVE_NOM: 0.6V, 600 MHz  
6. ACTIVE_HIGH: 0.8V, 800 MHz

Transition Matrix:
OFF ↔ RETENTION ↔ IDLE ↔ ACTIVE_*
ACTIVE_LOW ↔ ACTIVE_NOM ↔ ACTIVE_HIGH

Transition Times:
- Power-up: OFF → ACTIVE_NOM: 100 μs
- DVFS: ACTIVE_LOW ↔ ACTIVE_HIGH: 20 μs
- Power-down: ACTIVE → OFF: 10 μs
```

## Energy Optimization Strategy

### Dynamic Power Reduction
```
Clock Gating:
- Automatic clock gating insertion
- Activity-based gating control
- Multi-level gating hierarchy
- 90%+ gating coverage target

Power Gating:
- Tile-level power switches
- Function-level isolation
- Retention register support
- Wake-up sequencing

Voltage Scaling:
- Performance-based DVFS
- Workload-adaptive scaling
- Predictive voltage control
- Energy-aware scheduling
```

### Leakage Power Minimization
```
Multi-Vt Strategy:
- HVT: Non-critical paths (70%)
- RVT: Balanced paths (25%)
- LVT: Critical paths only (5%)

Body Biasing (22nm FDX):
- Forward bias: Performance boost
- Reverse bias: Leakage reduction
- Dynamic bias control
- Temperature compensation

Power Gating:
- Fine-grained sleep transistors
- Retention planning
- Wake-up time optimization
- Area overhead <5%
```

### Measurement and Monitoring
```
On-Chip Power Monitors:
- Current sensors per domain
- Voltage monitors (0.1% accuracy)
- Temperature sensors (1°C accuracy)
- Activity counters per block

External Measurement:
- High-accuracy power analyzer
- Multi-channel synchronization
- Real-time data logging
- Energy per inference calculation
```
