- Timing violations and margin analysis
- Power and area optimization opportunities

## Updated Constraint Files

### neuraedge_npu_updated_timing_constraint_update_20250814_023308.sdc
- **Type**: timing constraints
- **Size**: 11024 bytes
- **Lines**: 255
- **Purpose**: Address timing violations and margins

## Key Updates Applied

### Timing Constraints
- Clock frequency adjustments based on simulation results
- Enhanced setup/hold margins for critical paths
- Updated multicycle path constraints for MAC operations
- Improved clock domain crossing constraints

### Power Constraints  
- Clock gating enablement for 4+ bit registers
- Power domain isolation for PE and NoC blocks
- Activity factor constraints for switching analysis
- Leakage power budgets per functional block

### Area Constraints
- Maximum area targets per design block
- Resource sharing for arithmetic units
- Wire load model optimization
- Hierarchy preservation controls

## Implementation Guidelines
1. **Use updated constraints** in next synthesis iteration
2. **Validate timing closure** with new constraints
3. **Monitor area/power impact** of constraint changes
4. **Iterate based on results** from updated netlists

## Next Steps
1. Re-run synthesis with updated constraints
2. Verify timing closure improvements
3. Validate power and area targets
4. Update gate-level simulation with new netlists
