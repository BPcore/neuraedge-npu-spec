## Clock Tree Architecture

### Hierarchical Distribution Strategy
1. **Global Level (M8/M7):**

   - Target: 25ps skew between quadrants

2. **Quadrant Level (M6/M5):**
   - Secondary distribution within each quadrant
   - Medium drive buffers (X8) for load balancing
   - 1.5µm minimum width routing
   - Target: 35ps intra-quadrant skew

3. **Local Level (M4-M2):**
   - Tile-level clock distribution
   - Local buffers (X4) for final drive
   - Standard width routing (0.5µm minimum)
   - Target: 50ps global tile-to-tile skew

### Phase 2: Quadrant Distribution (M6/M5)  
- Expand within each quadrant to sub-regions
- Balance loads with secondary buffers
- Minimize intra-quadrant skew variations
- Target: 25ps max skew within quadrant

### Phase 3: Local Distribution (M4-M2)
- Connect to individual tiles and IP blocks
- Final buffer insertion for drive requirements
- Achieve global skew targets
- Target: 50ps max global skew
